# Hurricane Damage Reporter

## Team Details
- **Team Member**: Baron Liu  
- **Team Number**: 19
- **Why I used what I used**: I'll be honest Streamlit is the GOAT of making projects as fast as possible, also python is easy to write in and postgresql because I was just familiar with it.

## Project Overview
The Hurricane Damage Reporter is a web-based application designed to allow users to report and visualize hurricane damage in their area. Users can submit details such as:

- **Name of the affected location**
- **Address of the location**
- **Severity of the damage** (scale 1-10)
- **Category of the damage** (e.g., Flood, Fire, Wind Damage, Other)

All submissions are stored in a PostgreSQL database and displayed on an interactive map using Folium, integrated with Streamlit.
